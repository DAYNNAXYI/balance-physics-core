  note = {Core equation: $x^y + Fx = y^F$ where $x$ is normalized input, $y$ is normalized output, $F$ is structural parameter. The formalism includes AePhy for phase transitions: $\Phi^m + k\Phi = m^k$ with $\Phi = \sqrt[3]{T \cdot H \cdot V}$.},

  abstract = {We propose a new balance-based approach where the fundamental relation is a balance between nonlinear potential, linear response, and power cost. The formalism naturally explains bistability ($0<F<1$), infinite solution regimes ($F<F_{\text{crit}}$), and reduces to classical linear laws at $F=1$.}
